# AVME Wallet - How to test your DApp locally

Once your DApp is built, you can test it locally without having to submit it to the repo.

Starting from AVME Wallet v2.0.0, do the following steps:

1. Go to the Settings screen (the little cog on the bottom left).
2. Check the "Developer Mode" setting. This will enable an extra option in the Applications screen.
3. Go to the Applications screen and click on "Open Local App".
4. Select your DApp's root folder and confirm.

You only need the **main.qml** file for testing locally. The other two files (**icon.png** and **files.json**) are only required when submitting your DApp to the repo.
